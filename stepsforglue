1. **Initialize a CDK Project:**
   - Create a new folder for your project (e.g., `cdk-project-aws-glue-elt`).
   - Initialize with CDK to get access to template files and CLI tools.
     ```bash
     cdk init my-app --template-name cdk-template --region us-west-2
     cdk create my-app
     ```

2. **Create the Glue Job Definition:**
   - Implement a `GlueJob.java` that extends `GlueClusterJobDefinition` and implements ETL.
   - Define sources, sinks, and transformers to process data.

3. **Develop the Run Task:**
   - Create `RunGlueJob.java` as a simple Glue task that triggers your job definition.

4. **Set Up the IAM Role:**
   - Implement `AWSGlueRole.java` using CDK template methods.
   - Add necessary principals (IAM, EC2, Glue Execution) and grant permissions for S3 access.

5. **Define the IAM Policy:**
   - Create an ETLExecutionPolicy.json file to allow execution of tasks with appropriate permissions on S3.

6. **Create an IAM User/Role:**
   - Develop `ETLUser.java` with a constructor that accepts a username parameter to assume the Glue ARN.

7. **Deploy Resources in AWS Glue Console:**
   - Attach IAM policies to your Glue Stack.
   - Enable all stages (Batch Transform, Direct Connect, etc.) for automatic job execution.

8. **Test and Validate:**
   - Use `RunGlueJob` to test the pipeline by invoking it via a Lambda function or directly from the CLI.

9. **Handle Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Integrate CloudWatch Logs if needed for detailed tracking of Glue jobs.

By following these steps, you can systematically set up an AWS Glue ETL service using CDK, ensuring each component is 
correctly configured and tested.
